The reins of government had been seized by three scheming and incompetent Pashas, and the halfhearted attempt to move to a congressional monarchy had been suspended. The economy was completely dominated by foreign debts and the concessions to the allied powers had spiraled completely out of control. The first world war had been a complete disaster, and the blame had been placed squarely on minorities: Greeks, Assyrians, and especially Armenians, who had already been massacred during the reign of Abdülhamid the Damned and were now having a full-on genocide inflicted upon them. A quarter of the population of the Ottomans had perished (mostly self-inflicted, in the aforementioned genocides). The one bright side, that Konstantiniyye had been bravely defended against all odds in 1915 and the invaders had been driven back into the sea, was now stripped away again. The Allies were carving up the spoils of war, and the Sultan had sold out his country for his own skin and had signed the Treaty of Sevrés, perhaps the most unequal treaty that resulted from the Great War, even more punishing than the Infamous Treaty of Versailles. Anatolia was fated to be split into French, Greek, Armenian, and Italian protectorates (a.k.a. colonies to be abused and exploited) with only a rump state left for the Sultan to rule out of nostalgia more than anything."),

Fortunately, Mustafa Kemal believed in progress at any cost, and was well aware of how close they had come to complete ruin, and how perilous the situation still remained. He was inaugurated as the country's first President (an election he would have surely rigged if he wasn't sure to win anyways. How does one vote against the man who singlehandedly saved everyone from being brutally oppressed and conquered? He won almost unanimously without lifting a finger), and the political body that was composed almost entirely of the very same veteran officers who had spent the past ten years following his orders had continued to do exactly that. The one-party period from was characterized by long overdue and even progressive reforms: Turkey became the third country in the world to grant women the right to vote and the first to grant them the right to run for office. The Alphabet was changed, and literacy jumped from under 10% to over 90% practically overnight. A new, secular penal and civil code was introduced, and the Ottoman Caliphate - the last Caliphate - was abolished and would never return. And of course, everyone was told to take a last name, or have one be assigned for them."),

The Soviet Union had done much to fund the revolution, but the nascent republic, knowing how... unpopular communists were, kept them at arm's length. In fact, it kept most countries at a distance for this reform period, quick to try and put the wars and genocides with Greece and Armenia behind it and recover as quickly and as quietly as possible. During this period, a Kurdish attempt at independence had been brutally put down - after decades of war, Atatürk did not want to take any chances."),

		"Eventually, Atatürk died of cirrhosis in 1938 on the eve of the Second World War. He was succeeded by his Prime Minister İsmet İnönü (until 2016, Turkey had both a Prime Ministerial and a Presidential office. Almost every president after İnönü was irrelevant until the 21st century), a diplomatic mastermind and right-hand man of Atatürk. He spent Herculean efforts and considerable resources making sure that the country would remain exactly where it was. It signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany after watching how easily they had rolled through the Balkans, and the population was still recovering anyways. They had agreed with basically everyone that it was better if Turkey was not involved in World War II. They sold chrome to both sides during the war and kept a tight lid on fascist and communist forces within the country, until in 1944 it became clear that the Third Reich would be defeated. After having sat out the entire conflict (not that they had much choice), they declared war on Germany and Japan in February of 1945, and because of it were eligible to join the United Nations later that year."),

The pressure for multi-party elections came to a head, and the first competitive election was held in 1946. İsmet İnönü's party, the Cumhuriyet ve Halk Partisi or CHP, won this election. And would never win another election again. İnönü lost the presidency in 1950. And thus came the government of Adnan Menderes."),

Atatürk). Turkey finally left its neutrality and had become a member of the fledgling NATO alliance, after witnessing how the Soviets had rolled into the Eastern bloc and then did not roll out after. They even participated in their first international exercise with their allies - the Korean War, where Turkish forces were lauded for heroism and resilience. But soon after, the economy began to fail, and Menderes introduced censorship laws to limit dissent. He also had a false flag bombing done against the home of Atatürk to instigate the Istanbul pogrom against Greeks. In the end, the military for the first time decided that it was the ultimate guardian of Atatürk's Republic and launched the first of many, many coups (this will become something of a trend). Adnan Menderes was executed in 1960 in İmralı Prison - a Turkish Alcatraz in the middle of the Sea of Marmara."),

The Military overthrew the government yet again just ten years later in 1971, even having the audacity to warn the civilian government that they would do so if they did not get their act together. The government returned to civilian control in 1973, just in time for another wave of violence between Turks and Greeks on the island of Cyprus. The island had been subject to a treaty back in 1960, but the Greek government had instigated a coup (of course) in Cyprus in favor of joining with Greece. Given that the Island was less than an hour boat ride from the coast of Turkey, and that Greece still held (and continues to hold) the vast majority of islands in the Aegean Sea and continues to limit its supposed ally Turkey's access to its own waters, Turkey deemed this unacceptable and took the proportionate and measured response of... unilaterally invading the island and carving out a third of it. This dispute is, notably, ongoing. As a reward for its actions, Turkey was summarily sanctioned and embargoed for a few years by almost all its allies and rivals, which only added to the nation's woes."),

Police arrested people indiscriminately and without charge, and tortured random people for suspected communist leanings - its own little red scare. Over 5,000 people died. At last, the military launched a coup in 1980 and proclaimed martial law, finally reinstalling order. It would not last."),

		"Civilian control returned in 1982 under the globalist yet socially conservative government of Turgut Özal, though the military maintained tight control of the government and the threat of coup was ever present. But the gridlock had been removed by the heavy-handed requirement in the new constitution that parties could only be represented if they collected more than 10% of the vote. This would certainly not come back to bite the military in the future. The PKK insurgency - a Kurdish communist terror group originally demanding independence but now demanding cultural and social recognition in Turkey, though still conducting some bombings and violence which really isn't helping matters - also began during this time. Turgut Özal sought peace with many of these groups, managing to negotiate a ceasefire with Kurdish groups and bringing up the possibility of Armenian Genocide recognition and reparations. For this, he received a fatal dose of arsenic in his lemonade, and Armenia redoubled it's demands for Wilsonian Armenia. The genocide denial has continued since, and Turkey stumbled on. In 1995, the military did not even have to launch a coup - a mere memorandum resulted in the change in government that it wanted. But now hyperinflation was spiraling out of control, and the people had had enough. The parties in power were swept out in 2003, and a young politician named Tayyip Erdoğan rode the wave of unrest into the office to which he has remained since. "),

The Ergenekon trial, which almost undoubtedly used phony evidence of coup-plots, was used to imprison most of the power players in the Turkish government. Not that anyone really minded, as they were almost certainly plotting a coup anyways and everyone just wanted to be done with it."),

		"But as more authoritarian measures were taken, unrest grew. In 2013, the infamous Gezi Park protests against growing authoritarianism resulted in riots and death. In 2016, factions in the Turkish military attempted a coup (yes, it was a real coup, not a conspiracy. I was there smh) and failed. The subsequent purges of the military and academia numbered in the tens of thousands. In 2017, a memorandum resulted in another new constitution for Turkey, remade in Erdoğan's image. And in 2018, an economic crisis began which has resulted in inflation over 100% at times and persists into Turkey's 100th year. Its centennial is, as practically all its recent history, characterized by a government in political and economic crisis before, during, and after the Coronavirus Pandemic. Turkey remains at a precipice, sharply divided like much of the rest of the world, weighing authoritarian options and democratic ones. Things look bleak, and a catastrophic earthquake which destroyed 10 cities in early 2023 did not help matters."),

The Allies set to swift work partitioning the land and directly governing the people. However, when the British, French, Italian, and Greek militaries ordered the defeated commanders to stand down, the commanders usually instead disseminated munitions and provisions among the populace and refused to demobilize what forces had not already been killed during the war or defected into banditry (there were a lot of those).

This first phase of the revolution was known as the Kuva-yi Milliye phase, and characterized by nationalistic fervor: single incidents like a journalist firing at a standardbearer turning a city into a killzone.

The situation deteriorated rapidly, and by November Turkey found itself at war on all fronts once again. The Kuva-Yi Milliye would not be enough to stop the allies, though they would try their best between 1919 and 1920.
